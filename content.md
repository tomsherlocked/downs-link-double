- About the route

  - Completing the full double (St Martha's Hill->Shoreham->St Martha's Hill) is 120km long, with around 700m of elevation change. Most of this is in the very first/last kilometers, ascending St Martha's and Blackheath.
  - The vast majority of this route is offroad, following the disused Cranleigh line. The surface here is firm gravel, with a tendency to get puddly in winter. In summer, you could probably get away with a road bike on 28c tyres, and in winter a 29er hardtail mtb would be best. Year-round however, you'll be fastest on a gravel bike.
  - The very first/last section that drops off of St Martha's Hill is <em>very steep</em> and needs a lot of consideration before riding. The gradient tops out at around 20%, and the track is narrow with numerous large rocks, drops, roots and bits of old pipe, so should not be taken lightly. This part is the only section <em>not suited for gravel bikes</em>, however only lasts around 250m.
  - Most of the route is on bridlepaths, with the odd bit of road too - so the usual rules apply - <em>don't be a dick</em>, and give way to other users of the path.
  - The final stretch of the path to St Martha's is a footpath, so the Down's Link (and this route) start and ends at the WW2 Pillbox about halfway down the East side.
